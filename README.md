# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

I have been using this repository to keep track of all exercises within Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree
Program (see here: https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). Many of the notes are
taken from the Udacity repository (see here: https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), the solutions are my own
work.

Each problem is numerically ordered and located in its own directory. Each directory contains a README.md.
This details the problem we are trying to solve, key note I took during completion of the video lecture / external
resources.
